# PyActy
A library containing functions used in various branches of accounting.

While the practical application of this library is unbeknownst to me currently, it serves as a good practice exercise in both Python and accounting.

All releases will be tagged as v[YYYY].[MM].[DD]-rV.

- YYYY is the latest fiscal year the version is usable in.
- MM is the month the version was released in.
- DD is the day the version was released in.
- V is the revision, or number of releases made, for that day. This helps in the case that multiple versions occur on the same day.

In the event that the changes related to the tax functions aren't useable in the currently fiscal year, every update should be marked as v2023.12.31-r[V].
