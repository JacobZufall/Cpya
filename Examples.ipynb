    "> During an audit of Year 3, you select a computer to test the valuation of. The supporting documentation states that the client purchased this computer January 1, Year 1 for 4,500. The client assigned the computer a salvage value of 50, a life of 5 years as suggested by U.S. GAAP, and has consistently depreciated it using the straight-line method. The computer currently has a net value of 600 on the client's books."
